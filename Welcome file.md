Handwriting Recognition System - README

The Handwriting Recognition System is a software web application that recognizes handwritten text from images into digital text using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This README file provides instructions on how to install and use the system effectively.

Installation Process
To install and set up the Handwriting Recognition System, please follow these steps:
1.	Ensure you have Anaconda installed on your machine. If not, download and install Anaconda from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.
2.	Open Anaconda Prompt or any command line interface and navigate to the directory where the system's Python app is located.
3.	Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt	

4.	After installing the dependencies, start the application by running the following command:
python app.py

5.	Open your preferred web browser and enter the following URL: http://localhost:5000/main.
6.	The main interface of the Handwriting Recognition System will appear.
7.	If you are a new user, click on the "Signup" button to create a new account. Otherwise, log in using your existing credentials.
8.	Once logged in, you can upload an image containing handwritten text by clicking on the "Upload Image" button.
9.	Select the desired image file from your local storage and start the recognition process.
10.	The system will analyze the handwriting and provide the converted digital text as the output.
11.	You can perform multiple recognition tasks by repeating steps 9 to 11.

System Requirements
The Handwriting Recognition System has the following system requirements:
•	Operating System: Windows.
•	Anaconda (Python 3.x) installed
•	Internet connection for dependencies installation and user authentication
